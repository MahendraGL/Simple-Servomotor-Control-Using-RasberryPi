# Simple-Servomotor-Control-Using-RasberryPi
- In this small repository, I have given simple code for Servomotor control.
- Control the motor by changing the dutycycle[DC] of the PWM signal, which is generated by RPi-4 board.
- I have used board mode for GPIO with pin 40 as an output pin.
- A frequency of 50Hz is used, and accordingly, DC was varied from 0 degree to 180 degrees. Minor modifications in the code help you to easily alter the DC using the python command 'Input'.
