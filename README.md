# Simple-Servomotor-Control-Using-RasberryPi
- In this small repositroy I have given simple code for Servomotor control.
- Control the motor by changing dutycycle[DC] of the PWM signal, which is generted by RPi-4 board.
- I have used board mode for GPIO with pin 40 as output pin.
- Frequency of 50Hz is used and accordingly DC was varied for 0 degree to 180 degrees. Small modification in the code would help you to easily vary the DC using python command 'Input'.
